# Timeline component project
This project is a timeline component that can be used to display a list of events in a chronological order.
The component is built using React, Typescript and CSS.

## Features
- Display the events in a vertical timeline
- Display a list of events in a chronological order
- Zoom in and out of the timeline
- Dragging one event into another changes the start date on the drop target event
- Inline editing of the event is done by clicking on the pencil icon, and then clicking out of the event to save the changes

## Installation
- Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies
- Run `yarn start` to start the development server
- Run `yarn test` to run the tests
- Run `yarn build` to build the project

## Challenge questions
- How long you spent on the assignment.
  - Close to 6 hours of work in total
- What you like about your implementation
  - I like the way the timeline is displayed and the way the events are displayed in a chronological order
  - The drag and drop feature works well
  - The inline editing of the event is simple but effective
  - The zoom feature is also simple but effective
- What you would change if you were going to do it again.
  - I would make it possible to save events in a persistent storage
  - I would improve the zoom feature so it doesn't hides part of the app when in max zoom
  - I would add more tests and seek for better coverage
- How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
  - I looked at some timeline components on the internet to get some [inspiration](https://ft.syncfusion.com/featuretour/react-js2/images/timeline/react-timeline-opposite-content.png) on how to display the events in a timeline
  - I also looked some [examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API#examples) to implement the drag and drop feature
- How you would test this if you had more time.
  - Test the drag and drop feature better
  - Test the zoom feature
  - Add and test the responsiveness of the app
  - Add more tests to improve the coverage
